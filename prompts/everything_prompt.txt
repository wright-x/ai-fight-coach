IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON object with this exact structure:
{
  "highlights": [
    {
      "timestamp": "00:15",
      "short_text": "Tuck your chin and keep your guard up",
      "long_text": "At 15 seconds, I observed that your guard was slightly lowered and your chin was exposed. This creates a vulnerability that an opponent could exploit. You should maintain a tight guard position with your hands protecting your face at all times, and keep your chin tucked down to minimize exposure to head shots.",
      "action_required": "Widen your stance for better balance and power. This will significantly improve your defensive positioning. Keep your hands up at all times to protect your face.",
      "problem_location": "specific_body_part_or_general"
    }
  ],
  "recommended_drills": [
    {
      "drill_name": "Name of the drill",
      "description": "How to perform the drill",
      "problem_it_fixes": "What problem this drill addresses"
    }
  ],
  "youtube_recommendations": [
    {
      "title": "Video Title",
      "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...",
      "description": "Why this video helps",
      "problem_it_fixes": "Specific problem this addresses"
    }
  ]
}

CRITICAL: For each highlight, provide both:
- "short_text": A concise, punchy summary for TTS and on-screen captions (max 80 characters)
- "long_text": A detailed, paragraph-form explanation for the web results page
- "action_required": MUST be 6-8 words longer than current examples. Format as 2-3 short, distinct sentences separated by periods. This creates natural pauses for professional TTS narration. Example: "Widen your stance for better balance and power. This will significantly improve your defensive positioning. Keep your hands up at all times to protect your face."
