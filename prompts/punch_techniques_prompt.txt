SCHEMA:
{
    "highlights": [
        {
            "timestamp": "00:15",
            "short_text": "Extend your jab fully",
            "long_text": "At 15 seconds, I noticed your jab wasn't extending fully. You were pulling it back too quickly, which reduces both reach and power. A proper jab should extend completely with your shoulder rotating forward and your fist turning over at the end of the punch.",
            "action_required": "What the fighter should do differently (1 sentence)"
        }
